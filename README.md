### 2D Cluster Finding with the Help of Enhanced Deep Residual Networks (EDSR)

This work presents a novel algorithm for 2D cluster finding utilizing Enhanced Deep Residual Networks (EDSR)[1]. The challenge of accurately identifying points within images is addressed by processing pixel matrices to locate clusters effectively. The algorithm follows a three-step process: identifying local maxima, clustering around these points, and calculating weighted averages to determine cluster centers.

### Datasets

`Clusters_2D_100.txt`: A dataset of 100 images, each of them have 64 $\times$ 64 pixels and 10 clusters in it.

`Clusters_2D_100_30.txt`: A dataset of 100 images, each of them have 64 $\times$ 64 pixels and 30 clusters in it.
